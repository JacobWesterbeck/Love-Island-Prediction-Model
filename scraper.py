from the link above - build a scraper that goes and grabs status from islanders table - and plugs status in - I only want to evaluate people with "participating" status- 
-I can pull day entered villa from this table as well and then have a standard current day variable so I can get lenth of stay


then from the  coupling table, I want to count DISTINCT names in each islanders row - 'Not in Villa' and 'Dumped (Day ##)' are the strings I want to ignore - I can use names deemed particiants to select correct number of unique couples for correct islander

I  will have to manually fill in eye color, hair color, height etc
